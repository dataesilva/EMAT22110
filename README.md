# EMAT22110
Content for the Kent State University course EMAT 22110 - Data in Emerging Media and Technology

### This course is structured around the Core Data Loop:
1. Asking good questions
1. Aquiring appropriate data
1. Analyzing data
1. Reporting Findings

In this course we run through this loop backwards. Starting with reporting using Jupyter Notebooks. Then learning to look at our data using visual analysis and descriptive statistics in Python 3 and R. We only briefly cover predictive data analysis before focusing in on data aquisition from various sources. Throughout the class, we discuss what makes for good questions and pairing appropriate data to those questions. We specifically talk about data limitations, bias, and ethical issues with digital trace data. This culminates in a final project, determined by you, that adds understanding to our complex world and communicates if effectively.
